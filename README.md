# Temporary repo of AsteroidOS TeamCity Project

This is a temporary repository documenting and sharing the AsteroidOS TeamCity CI. All URLs are temporary and will be removed once the CI is ready for production.

Pull requests are welcome. Simply point the Settings repository to your fork and commit the settings you desire either via the UI or manually editting the `.teamcity` folder
